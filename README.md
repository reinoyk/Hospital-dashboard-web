# Hospital Dashboard Web

A web-based application built with Laravel, designed to provide a comprehensive dashboard for hospital management. This project aims to help hospital administrators and staff monitor key metrics, manage resources, and improve patient care through data visualization and analytics.

## About The Project

This project is a web application that serves as a centralized dashboard for hospital operations. It is built using the Laravel PHP framework to offer real-time insights and a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of a hospital.

*(In this section, you should add more details about what your project does. For example: What problems does it solve? What are its main goals?)*

### Key Features

* **Real-time Data Visualization:** Tracks key hospital metrics.
* **Patient Management Overview:** (Describe what it shows, e.g., admissions, discharges, patient flow)
* **Resource Monitoring:** (Describe what it tracks, e.g., bed availability, staff allocation, equipment usage)
* **Reporting & Analytics:** (Describe what kind of reports or analytics it provides)
* **Secure User Authentication & Authorization:** (Leveraging Laravel's built-in features)
* **(Add other features specific to your project)**

*(Be sure to elaborate on each feature or replace these examples with the actual features of your dashboard.)*

### Built With

This section should list all the major frameworks, libraries, and tools that you have used to build your project.

* **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)**
* **[PHP](https://www.php.net/)**
* **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**
* **(Example: MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite - specify your database)**
* **(Example: Vue.js/React/Blade - specify your frontend templating/framework if any beyond Blade)**
* **(Example: Chart.js/D3.js for visualizations)**
* **(Add all other significant technologies used in your project)**

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

List any software or tools that need to be installed on a user's machine before they can run your project.

* **PHP** (Specify version, e.g., >= 8.1)
* **Composer**
* **Node.js & NPM** (If you are using Laravel Mix for frontend assets)
* **A web server** (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or use `php artisan serve`
* **A database server** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

You can typically install PHP, Composer, and your database using your system's package manager (like `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu, `yum` for CentOS/RHEL, `brew` for macOS).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/reinoyk/Hospital-dashboard-web.git](https://github.com/reinoyk/Hospital-dashboard-web.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd Hospital-dashboard-web
    ```
3.  **Install PHP dependencies using Composer**
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```
4.  **(Optional) Install NPM packages if you use Laravel Mix for frontend assets**
    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run dev # or npm run build
    ```
5.  **Create a copy of your .env file**
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
6.  **Generate an application key**
    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
7.  **Configure your `.env` file**
    Open the `.env` file and set your database connection details (DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, etc.) and any other environment-specific settings like `APP_URL`.
    ```env
    APP_NAME=HospitalDashboard
    APP_ENV=local
    APP_KEY=base64:yourGeneratedKeyHere=
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
8.  **Run database migrations (and seeders if you have them)**
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate
    ```
    If you have database seeders:
    ```sh
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
9.  **(Optional) Link storage directory**
    If your application uses public disk for storage (e.g., user uploads):
    ```sh
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Laravel development server:**
    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`.

    Alternatively, configure a virtual host with a web server like Apache or Nginx to point to the `public` directory of your project.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or the URL provided by `php artisan serve` or your configured vhost) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

Provide examples of how to use your application or showcase some of its functionalities. You can include screenshots or GIFs here if they are helpful.

*(For example: "Log in using the default credentials (if any provided by seeders) or register a new account. Once logged in, navigate to the 'Patients' tab to see an overview of current admissions." or "The main dashboard displays charts for bed occupancy and staff availability.")*

## API Endpoints (Optional)

If your Laravel application provides an API, list the main endpoints here, or link to a more detailed API documentation (e.g., Postman collection, Swagger/OpenAPI docs).

* `GET /api/patients` - Retrieves a list of patients.
* `POST /api/patients` - Adds a new patient.
* *(Add other relevant API endpoints)*

## Testing

Explain how to run the test suite for your application.

```sh
php artisan test
